  = note: the only appropriate formatting traits are:
          - ``, which uses the `Display` trait
          - `?`, which uses the `Debug` trait
          - `e`, which uses the `LowerExp` trait
          - `E`, which uses the `UpperExp` trait
          - `o`, which uses the `Octal` trait
          - `p`, which uses the `Pointer` trait
          - `b`, which uses the `Binary` trait
          - `x`, which uses the `LowerHex` trait
          - `X`, which uses the `UpperHex` trait
  = note: this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
